# 04-Code-Quiz

For this assignment, I have built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Developers Experience

This homework assignment has taught me more than any other one I have recieved. In the past week, I have spent 20+ hours working alone, as well as working with a tutor trying to fix any issues I had come across. Some things that I have taken away from this assignment are what NOT to do and what DOES NOT work in certain sections of code.

# Issues

1. I was not able to get the "View Highscores" link to redirect the page to the "score" div.

2. I was able to get my timer to work, as well as ALERT when = 0, but was not able to get the timer to stop if the quiz was completed before the timer reached 0.

3. I was not able to store the users score inside the local storage, as well as print the highscores from previous users.

4. I was not able to STOP the "TIMES UP!" alert from showing if the quiz was completed before the time stopped.
